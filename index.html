                            INR 1.5 Lakhs - 7 Lakhs. After completing a bachelor's degree, students can choose to pursue
                            postgraduate as well as doctoral degrees in the field of law such as, LLM and LLD.

                            Post successfully completing a law degree students can choose to pursue a career as a Lawyer
                            or a Judge. However, there are several prerequisites and other eligibility criteria that
                            must be fulfilled in order to make a career as mentioned above. The salary of a Lawyer in
                            India usually ranges between INR 4.50 L – 9 L annually. However, with experience and
                            exposure, the salary of a Lawyer can go upto as much as INR 57 L – 1 Crore. Check: BA LLB

                        <p>The Bachelor of Commerce degree[1] is designed to provide students with a wide range of
                            managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business; [2] see aside
                            listing. For a comparison with other business degrees, see Business education §
                            Undergraduate education.

                            Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their major, students
                            are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance,
                            economics, business management, human resources and marketing. Programs often require
                            foundational courses in business statistics and mathematics, and information systems.

                            Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established.
                            Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree[3] requires students to take the majority of their
                            courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

                            <b>Bachelor of Commerce (Honours): </b>
                            The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (HonsBCom or BComm (Hons) or HBCom) is further advanced.
                            The degree has a specialization aspect, analogous to the BBA, developing the student's
                            business skills and/or providing in-depth knowledge of the field.

                            It requires additional academic courses to be completed, and usually with higher academic
                            performance standards, and may also require a researched thesis component. It often serves
                            as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate
                            programs, including the Master of Commerce (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the Master of Business
                            Administration (MBA) degrees.

                            It may consist of a four-year program[4][5] or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a
                            three-year Bachelor's degree;[6] the one-year program is typically focused exclusively on a
                            single subject-area.[7][8][9]

                            <b>Duration:</b>
                            The curriculum generally lasts three years in Australia, New Zealand, Malta, South Africa,
                            some parts of Canada, and Hong Kong. The curriculum requires four years of study in India,
                            Republic of Ireland, the majority of Canada, Egypt, Ghana, the Philippines, the Netherlands,

                            In South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and some universities in India, the BCom
                            (Hons) degree is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, an
                            additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification.

                            In Pakistan, BCom is generally a 2-year duration degree, whereas BS Commerce, formerly known
                            as BCom (Hons) in the country, is a 4-year duration degree.

                        <p>The magazine Hotel Management was established in New York in 1922 by Ahrens Publishers.[2] It
                            absorbed or merged with various other hotel management magazines over the years, including
                            Hotel World, which had been established in 1875. The magazine sometimes took on other names
                            such as Hotel & Motel Management.,[3] reflecting these mergers or changes in the market.

                            Hotel Management delivered hotel news, analysis and operational strategies. Regular features
                            included special reports, research/top lists, hot products, technology, furniture, fixtures
                            and equipment, hotel operations, and trends and statistics. Later owners included Advanstar
                            Communications, Inc.[4][5]

                            In January 2011, the magazine was redesigned and renamed Hotel Management.[6] Following
                            these changes, the magazine began to cover articles about technology, development and
                            trends/statistics.[6] It is published fifteen times a year.[6] It was formerly published 21
                            times per year.[7] Its headquarters is in New York City.[7] </p>

                        <p>Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet and online-based
                            digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones, and other digital media and
                            platforms to promote products and services.[2][3]

                            It has significantly transformed the way brands and businesses utilize technology for
                            marketing since the 1990s and 2000s. As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated
                            into marketing plans and everyday life,[4] and as people increasingly used digital devices
                            instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent,
                            employing combinations of methods.
                            Some of these methods include: search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing
                            (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing,
                            data-driven marketing, e-commerce marketing, social media marketing, social media
                            optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display advertising, e-books, and optical disks and
                            games. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such
                            as television, mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callbacks, and on-hold mobile ringtones.[7]

                            The extension to non-Internet channels differentiates digital marketing from online

                                <p>The Bachelor of Commerce degree[1] is designed to provide students with a wide range of
                                    managerial skills, while building competence in a particular area of business; [2] see aside
                                    listing. For a comparison with other business degrees, see Business education §
                                    Undergraduate education.
        
                                    Most universities, therefore, plan the degree such that in addition to their major, students
                                    are exposed to general business principles, taking courses in accounting, finance,
                                    economics, business management, human resources and marketing. Programs often require
                                    foundational courses in business statistics and mathematics, and information systems.
        
                                    Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established.
                                    Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree[3] requires students to take the majority of their
                                    courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.

                                    The degree has a specialization aspect, analogous to the BBA, developing the student's
                                    business skills and/or providing in-depth knowledge of the field.
        
                                    It requires additional academic courses to be completed, and usually with higher academic
                                    performance standards, and may also require a researched thesis component. It often serves
                                    as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate
                                    programs, including the Master of Commerce (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the Master of Business

                                    It may consist of a four-year program[4][5] or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a
                                    three-year Bachelor's degree;[6] the one-year program is typically focused exclusively on a
                                    single subject-area.[7][8][9]

                                    In South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and some universities in India, the BCom
                                    (Hons) degree is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, an
                                    additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification.
        
                                    In Pakistan, BCom is generally a 2-year duration degree, whereas BS Commerce, formerly known

                                    absorbed or merged with various other hotel management magazines over the years, including
                                    Hotel World, which had been established in 1875. The magazine sometimes took on other names
                                    such as Hotel & Motel Management.,[3] reflecting these mergers or changes in the market.
        
                                    Hotel Management delivered hotel news, analysis and operational strategies. Regular features
                                    included special reports, research/top lists, hot products, technology, furniture, fixtures

                                    In January 2011, the magazine was redesigned and renamed Hotel Management.[6] Following
                                    these changes, the magazine began to cover articles about technology, development and

                                    platforms to promote products and services.[2][3]
        
                                    It has significantly transformed the way brands and businesses utilize technology for
                                    marketing since the 1990s and 2000s. As digital platforms became increasingly incorporated
                                    into marketing plans and everyday life,[4] and as people increasingly used digital devices
                                    instead of visiting physical shops,[5][6] digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent,
                                    employing combinations of methods.
                                    Some of these methods include: search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing
                                    (SEM), content marketing, influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing,

                                    games. Digital marketing extends to non-Internet channels that provide digital media, such
                                    as television, mobile phones (SMS and MMS), callbacks, and on-hold mobile ringtones.[7]
